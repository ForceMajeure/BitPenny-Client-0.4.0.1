# set 1 for pooled mining and 0 for solo mining
# can be changed with "setpool true|false" rpc command
pool=1

poolport=8338

# pooluserid must be a valid Bitcoin address
# this address is used for both pooled and solo mining
# nothing is stored in the local wallet.dat
# it is NOT advised to use the bitpennyd client as a wallet

# time interval in milliseconds to calculate shares per second
# can be changed via "setpoolinterval" rpc command

# bitpennyd automatically defaults to solo mining mode whenever the server is unavailable
# set the following parameter to 1 if you'd rather receive an HTTP 500 error instead of switching to solo mode
# get/setpooldisablesolo rpc commands are also available
# please note that bitpennyd provides an x-poolmode HTTP header to indicate the type of work returned
# the header value is set to 1 when pool work is returned, and 0 when solo work is returned
# this can be used by miners and proxies for further processing
pooldisablesolo=0

# built-in block monitor will notify your proxies/miners by sending 
# UDP messages to each registered target
# 		'New Block #####' on block change
# 		'Stale Block'     on lost connection to BitPenny server
#		'Pool Block' 	  when pool block becomes available while failed over to solo mode
# targets can also be added dynamically via "addblockmonitortarget [host] <udp port>" rpc command
# "listblockmonitortargets", "setblockmonitor", "getblockmonitor" commands are also supported
# please note, dynamically added targets will be lost after executing "setblockmonitor false" command or 
# after betpennyd is restarted 
# you will need to enable DNS lookup if below parameters use host names instead of ip addresses
